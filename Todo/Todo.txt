Open:
a) Fix Crossover (done --> needs to be looked at)
b) Fix UniqueID-Generation (same schedules seem to generate different IDs)
c) Fix Critical-Path method after Job-Nr 10 
z) Find alternatives for mutation after Crossover

Finished:
TASK A
1. Save a pool of solutions (not only the last)
- New class with a individuals collection
- Create a serialize-Method in individuals returning the schedule-String (solution-ID)

TASK B
2. Introduce a Crossover (1-point for example)

TASK C
3. Create a selection process for crossover (rank for example)

TASK E
4. Calculate the critical path (solution with unlimited resources)

TASK F
5. Read all 600 Files and create 50000 individual
6. Calculate the deviation from the critical path (current makespan/critical path)
7. Generate the average over all 600 deviation
