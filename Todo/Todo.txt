1. Save a pool of solutions (not only the last)
2. Introduce a Crossover (1-point for example)
3. Create a selection process for crossover (rank for example)
4. Calculate the critical path (solution without unlimited ressources)
5. Read all 600 Files and create 50000 individual
6. Calculate the deviation from the critical path (current makespan/critical path)
7. Generate the average over all 600 deviation
